## Express.js TC meetings

a live stream of the discussion and a recording of past meetings. Topics for the
meetings are determined on an as-needed basis and may be technical or management
of nature.

Current meeting schedule: Wednesdays 23:30 UTC

Recordings of past meetings are available on the [Express Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYjxjAeH6TRik9Iwy5nXw7g/videos).

## Decision Records

> [!TIP]
> If you is creating a new ADR, please use the [ADR template](docs/adr/adr-template.md) as a starting point.

We use [Architecture Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/) to record and
document decisions made by the Members of the Express.js.

You can find all the ADRs in the [docs/adr](docs/adr) directory.
