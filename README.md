## Current v5 Meeting Cadence

While focusing on releasing Express v5, the meeting schedule has been changed
from the normal schedule listed below. Until further notice, meetings will be
held on this cadence.

**Currently, meetings are held weekly on Thursdays at 4pm GMT.**

### If Stakeholders Not Available

If for some reason the host of the meeting is not available, but there are
participants who wish to discuss the agenda or other topics, an ad hoc meeting
can be started. If the host is not available for a scheduled meeting,
participants can post a link to a video chat in the scheduled meeting's issue.

Meetings should be recorded when appropriate, like regular meetings are, and
provided to the TC for uploading to the official youtube channel.

## Express.js TC meetings

The Express.js Technical Committe (TC) meets online every other week, providing
a live stream of the discussion and a recording of past meetings. Topics for the
meetings are determined on an as-needed basis and may be technical or management
of nature.

Normal meeting schedule: Wednesdays 23:30 UTC
