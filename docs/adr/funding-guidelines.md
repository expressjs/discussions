# ADR [Number]: Funding Use Guidelines

## Status

Proposed

## Submitters

- @ctcpip
- @UlisesGascon
- @wesleytodd

## Decision Owners

- @expressjs/express-tc

## Context

We have an Open Collective but we originally decided to wait on setting guidelines for how we will spend the funds. Now that we have landed PRs to include the `funding` field in `package.json` and also a link in the footer of the website, we wanted to have some loose guidelines so contributors know a little about how we intend to use financial support for the project.

## Decision

Funds are not automatically distributed.

TC members may request funds to be distributed for the following purposes:

- Living expenses (food, shelter, medicine/healthcare, transportation, utilities)
  - The requester need not specify any detail other than the amount being requested.
- Travel (hotel and airfare) to events related to Express or the greater Node/JS ecosystem. _Legal Requirement: at least 18 years old and recognized as adults in both the country of departure and the destination country, based on local laws (ref: [Age of Majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_majority))_
  - The requester should specify the event, location, and cost estimates for hotel and airfare.
- Equipment and hardware (devices, screens, internet services)
  - The requester should specify the type of equipment or service needed and how it relates to their work on Express.

Requests will be reviewed at the next possible opportunity, privately during an Express TC meeting. The Express TC also reserves the right to amend these guidelines via our standard decision making process.

## Implementation

Once approved, we will add this doc to the appropriate places within our project documentation (the contributing guide, website, OC landing page, etc).
